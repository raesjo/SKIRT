/** DustSystem is an abstract class for representing complete dust systems, including both a dust
    distribution (i.e. a complete description of the spatial distribution and optical properties of
    the dust) and a grid structure on which this distribution is discretized. There are specialized
    subclasses for use with oligochromatic and panchromatic simulations respectively. A DustSystem
    object contains a vector of dust cells, each of which contain all useful information on the
    dust within that particular piece of the configuration space. Furthermore, a DustSystem object
    contains pointers a DustDistribution object and to a DustGridStructure object). A subclass
    may of course maintain additional information depending on its needs. */
