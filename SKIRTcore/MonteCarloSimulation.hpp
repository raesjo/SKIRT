    system and the number of photon packages that will be launched during the simulation run for

    /** This function determines how the specified number of photon packages should be split over
        chunks, and stores the resulting parameters in protected data members. It should be called
        at the start of each photon shooting phase.

        A chunk is the unit of parallelization in the simulation, i.e. multiple chunks may be performed
        simultaneously in different execution threads. The number of photons launched in a chunk,
        called the chunk size, is the same for all chunks in the simulation. All photon packages in a
        chunk have the same wavelength. If no photon packages must be launched for the simulation, the
        number of chunks is trivially zero. If the number of photon packages is nonzero, we
        differentiate between 3 cases to calculate the number of chunks:
        -# if the current simulation is <b>not parallelized</b> at all, i.e. the number of processes as
        well as the number of threads per process is one, there is no reason to split the photon
        packages into chunks, so the double MonteCarloSimulation::thermalvelocitydistribution(double a,double x)number of chunks per wavelength is set to one;
        -# if <b>only multithreading</b> is used (the number of processes is one), the number of chunks
        is determined by the condition that a decent load balancing is obtained among the execution
        threads. Therefore, we dictate that at least 10 chunks (across all wavelengths) are executed by
        each thread. This condition can be written as: \f[\boxed{N_\text{chunks} > 10\times
        \frac{N_\text{threads}}{N_\lambda}}\f] To further enhance the load balancing, we additionally
        enforce the chunks to not consist of more than \f$S_\text{max}=10^7\f$ photon packages:
        \f[\boxed{N_\text{chunks} > \frac{N_\text{pp}}{S_\text{max}}}\f]
        -# when <b>multiprocessing and multithreading</b> are used in combination, an additional
        criterion must be met, regarding the load balancing between the parallel processes: the number
        of chunks (per wavelength) should at least be 10 times the number of processes, since these
        chunks will be distributed amongst the processes by the designated ProcessAssigner. This
        condition can be expressed mathematically as: \f[\boxed{N_\text{chunks} > 10 \times
        N_\text{procs}}\f] The criterion that ensures load balancing between the threads remains, but
        is slightly altered to include the threads from all parallel processes
        (\f$N_\text{threads}\times N_\text{procs}\f$). This condition can then be formulated as "the
        total number of chunks (across all wavelengths) per process must at least be 10 times the
        number of threads". This translates into the following mathematical expression: \f[
        \frac{N_\text{chunks} \times N_\lambda}{N_\text{procs}} > 10 \times N_\text{threads} \f] Which
        in turn can be rewritten into the following form: \f[ \boxed{N_\text{chunks} > 10 \times
        \frac{N_\text{threads} \times N_\text{procs}}{N_\lambda}} \f] The final condition prevents the
        chunks from being overly large (\f$S_\text{max}=10^7\f$): \f[\boxed{N_\text{chunks} >
        \frac{N_\text{pp}}{S_\text{max}}}\f] */

        direction of the observer(s) instead of in the propagation direction \f${\bf{k}}\f$
        determined randomly by the scattering process. Each peel-off photon package has the same
        characteristics as the original photon package, apart from three differences. The first one
        is, obviously, that the propagation direction is altered to the direction
        \f${\bf{k}}_{\text{obs}}\f$ towards the observer. The second difference is that we have to
        alter the luminosity of the photon package to compensate for this change in propagation
        direction. This compensation is necessary because the scattering process is anisotropic.
        Since we force the peel-off photon package to be scattered from the direction
        \f${\bf{k}}\f$ into the direction \f${\bf{k}}_{\text{obs}}\f$, we give it as additional
        weight factor the probability that a photon package would be scattered into the direction
        \f${\bf{k}}_{\text{obs}}\f$ if its original propagation direction was \f${\bf{k}}\f$. If
        there is only one dust component in the dust system, this weight factor is equal to the
        scattering phase function \f$w= \Phi_\ell({\bf{k}},{\bf{k}}_{\text{obs}})\f$ of the dust
        mixture at the wavelength index of the photon package. If there are different dust
        components, each with their own density and dust mixture, the appropriate weight factor is
        a weighted mean of the scattering phase functions, \f[ w = \frac{ \sum_h
        \kappa_{\ell,h}^{\text{sca}}\, \rho_{m,h}\, \Phi_{\ell,h}({\bf{k}}, {\bf{k}}_{\text{obs}})
        }{ \sum_h \kappa_{\ell,h}^{\text{sca}}\, \rho_{m,h} }, \f] where \f$\rho_{m,h}\f$ is the
        density of the dust corresponding to the \f$h\f$'th dust component in the dust cell where
        the scattering event takes place, and \f$\kappa_{\ell,h}^{\text{sca}}\f$ and
        \f$\Phi_{\ell,h}\f$ are the scattering coefficient and phase function corresponding to the
        \f$h\f$'th dust component respectively (both evaluated at the wavelength index \f$\ell\f$
        of the photon package). The third difference is that the polarization state of the peel off
        photon package is adjusted. If there are multiple dust components, the weight factors
        described above are used not just for the luminosity but also for the components of the
        Stokes vector. For each instrument in the instrument system, the function creates such a
        peel-off photon package and feeds it to the instrument. The first argument specifies the
        photon package that was just emitted; the second argument provides a placeholder peel off
        photon package for use by the function. */

    /** This function simulates the continuous peel-off of a series of photon packages along the
        path of the original photon package. It should be called before the
        simulateescapeandabsorption() function, because it assumes that the photon package still
        has its original luminosity. Peel-off photon packages are created for each non-empty dust
        cell in the original photon package's path, and for every instrument in the instrument
        system. Each peel-off package starts at a random location \f${\bf{r}}_{\text{cell}}\f$

        factor \f$w_{\text{obs}}\f$ compensates for the change in propagation direction, and is
        determined as explained for the function peeloffscattering(). */

    /** This function simulates the escape from the system and the absorption by dust of a fraction
        of the luminosity of a photon package. It actually splits the luminosity \f$L_\ell\f$ of
        the photon package in \f$N+2\f$ different parts, with \f$N\f$ the number of dust cells
        along its path through the dust system: a part \f$L_\ell^{\text{esc}}\f$ that escapes from
        the system, a part \f$L_\ell^{\text{sca}}\f$ that is scattered before it leaves the system,
        and \f$N\f$ parts \f$L_{\ell,n}^{\text{abs}}\f$, each of them corresponding to the fraction
        that is absorbed in a dust cell along the path. The part that scatters is the actual part
        of the photon package that survives and continues in the photon package's life cycle. So we
        alter the luminosity of the photon package from \f$L_\ell\f$ to \f$L_\ell^{\text{sca}}\f$.
        If dust emission is not considered in the simulation, that is also the only part that
        matters. On the other hand, if dust emission is taken into account in the simulation, we
        have to simulate the absorption of the fractions \f$L_{\ell,n}^{\text{abs}}\f$ by the
        appropriate dust cells. It is obviously crucial to have expressions for
        \f$L_\ell^{\text{sca}}\f$ and \f$L_{\ell,n}^{\text{abs}}\f$ (and \f$L_\ell^{\text{esc}}\f$,
        but this does not really matter...). If we denote the total optical depth along the path of
        the photon package as \f$\tau_{\ell,\text{path}}\f$ (this quantity is stored in the
        PhotonPackage object provided as an input parameter of this function), the fraction
        of the luminosity that escapes from the system without any interaction is \f[
        L_\ell^{\text{esc}} = L_\ell\, {\text{e}}^{-\tau_{\ell,\text{path}}}. \f] Remains to
        subdivide the remainder of the initial luminosity, \f[ L_\ell \left( 1 -
        {\text{e}}^{-\tau_{\ell,\text{path}}} \right), \f] between the scattered fraction
        \f$L_\ell^{\text{sca}}\f$ and the \f$N\f$ absorbed fractions \f$L_{\ell,n}^{\text{abs}}\f$.
        When there is only one single dust component, the optical properties of the dust are the
        same everywhere along the path, and we easily have \f[ L_\ell^{\text{sca}} = \varpi_\ell\,
        L_\ell \left( 1 - {\text{e}}^{-\tau_{\ell,\text{path}}} \right) \f] with \f[ \varpi_\ell =
        \frac{ \kappa_\ell^{\text{sca}} }{ \kappa_\ell^{\text{ext}} } \f] the scattering albedo of
        the dust, and \f[ L_{\ell,n}^{\text{abs}} = (1-\varpi_\ell)\, L_\ell \left(
        {\text{e}}^{-\tau_{\ell,n-1}} - {\text{e}}^{-\tau_{\ell,n}} \right), \f] with
        \f$\tau_{\ell,n}\f$ the optical depth measured from the initial position of the path until
        the exit point of the \f$n\f$'th dust cell along the path (this quantity is also stored in
        the PhotonPackage object). It is straightforward to check that the sum of escaped, scattered
        and absorbed luminosities is \f[ L_\ell^{\text{esc}} + L_\ell^{\text{sca}} +
        \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} L_{\ell,n}^{\text{abs}} = L_\ell, \f] as desired. When there is more than
        one dust component, the dust properties are no longer uniform in every cell and things
        become a bit more messy. The expression for \f$L_{\ell,n}^{\text{abs}}\f$ can be readily
        expanded from the corresponding expression in the case of a single dust component, \f[
        L_{\ell,n}^{\text{abs}} = (1-\varpi_{\ell,n})\, L_\ell \left( {\text{e}}^{-\tau_{\ell,n-1}}
        - {\text{e}}^{-\tau_{\ell,n}} \right). \f] The only change is that the global albedo
        \f$\varpi_\ell\f$ is now replaced by a local albedo \f$\varpi_{\ell,n}\f$. It is found as
        the weighted mean of the albedo of the different dust components in the \f$n\f$'th dust
        cell along the path, \f[ \varpi_{\ell,n} = \frac{ \sum_h \kappa_{\ell,h}^{\text{sca}}\,
        \rho_{h,n} }{ \sum_h \kappa_{\ell,h}^{\text{ext}}\, \rho_{h,n} } \f] with \f$\rho_{h,n}\f$
        the density of the \f$h\f$'th dust component in the \f$n\f$'th cell. To calculate
        \f$L_\ell^{\text{sca}}\f$, we also have to take into account that the albedo varies from
        cell to cell, \f[ L_\ell^{\text{sca}} = L_\ell\, \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \varpi_{\ell,n} \left(
        {\text{e}}^{-\tau_{\ell,n-1}} - {\text{e}}^{-\tau_{\ell,n}} \right). \f] Also in this case,
        it is easy to see that \f[ L_\ell^{\text{esc}} + L_\ell^{\text{sca}} + \sum_{n=0}^{N-1}
        L_{\ell,n}^{\text{abs}} = L_\ell. \f] */
